<div class="about-header">
  <h2 class="about-mission-header">Mission Statement</h2>
  <h3 class="about-content">To bring glory to GOD by rescuing and caring for HIS dogs.</h3>
  <h2 class="about-title">Finding Our Passion</h2>
  <p class="about-content">Bernie: In December of 2006 we adopted him. He was the runt of the litter
    but he was the sweetest boy so we took him. At 4 months he collaped while running.
    We later found out that he had hip dysplasia. After this he could walk and play but
    not very well. He lived a seditary life for 9 years, a life filled with love and compassion.
  </p>
  <p class="about-content">Lucy: We adopted Lucy at PetSmart during an adoption event in May 2007. She had been thrown into
    ditch outside of a PetSmart employees house. She was the kindest and smartest dog ever.
    We could be bias.
  </p>
  <p class="about-content">Daisy: In June of 2007 we adopted Daisy from the same shelter. She had
    pnumonia and was not expected to survive. We were able to nurse her back to health and she lived
    a full live of love as well.
  </p>
  <p class="about-content">Alice: In August of 2007 we adopted Alice from, you guessed it the shelter. We
    were told by staff that she would never be a pet. She dove under the bed for 6 months. We fed her
    and watered her there. She did come out to go to the bathroom. Then one night at 1am she was on the
    bed panting. She wanted to play! She was a great dog.
  </p>
  <p class="about-content">Robbie: In July of 2014 I had just been laid off but there were two dogs on the side
    of the road. Robbie was taking care of the other dog. He had been hit by a car and did not survive. We took
    Robbie in and he has been the sweetest dog ever. He is still going strong at (at least) 10 years old, although
    he like a more sublte life now.
  </p>
<p class="about-content">We could go on and tell you about Walker and the rest but you get the idea. Please
  <a href="#" class="link">share your story</a> so we can share it as well. Every rescue dog has their own
  story to tell so what's yours?
